# Wave Illusion

This is a wave illusion that I saw from a YouTube video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VL3ifsL3byQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VL3ifsL3byQ).

The balls seem to move like a wave when watched together. But on their own, they only really move left to right; each ball just has its own different starting point.
